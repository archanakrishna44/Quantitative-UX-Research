## Notes for new users

**Files the agent manages — do not edit by hand:**
- `project_state.md` — the agent's memory for the study. Editing it directly will corrupt the workflow state.
- `analysis_plan_locked.md` — locked at S6 approval and hash-verified. Any edit will cause a hash mismatch and halt the agent.
- `state_log.jsonl` — append-only audit trail. The agent writes to this; it is never edited.
- `dry_run/` — temporary outputs from the agent's pre-flight check before live analysis runs.
- `agent/system_prompt.sha256` and `agent/agent_manifest.sha256` — hash files verified at every session start. Do not edit by hand; both are regenerated by running `python3 agent/generate_manifest.py`, which the agent does only after you explicitly confirm a config change (`CONFIRM PROMPT UPDATE`).

**Files worth knowing about:**
- `deviations.md` — if anything changes from the locked analysis plan during S7, the agent logs it here. This file is reproduced in the final results report.
- `state_log.jsonl` — if something goes wrong and you need to understand what the agent did and when, this is the audit trail.
- `scripts/validators/README.md` — if the agent surfaces a validator error, start here to understand what it means.
- `agent/init_check.sh` — runs silently at every session start to verify the agent's configuration files. Do not delete it.
- `agent/generate_manifest.py` — regenerates `agent_manifest.sha256` if you ever update a config file and need to re-verify it. You will not need this under normal use.

**Adding your data (S5):**
1. Open your file manager and navigate to `studies/<study_name>/data/raw/`.
2. Copy or move your CSV or Excel file into that folder.
3. In the Claude Code chat, tell the agent the filename.

**Viewing results (S7):**
- Open `report/results.docx` from your file manager — it opens in Microsoft Word or any compatible word processor.
- Tables: `outputs/tables/` — open `.xlsx` files in Excel.
- Figures: `outputs/figures/` — open `.png` files in any image viewer.

**Hidden folder:**
`.claude/` is a hidden folder. To view it: on macOS press `Cmd+Shift+.` in Finder; on Windows enable 'Show hidden items' in File Explorer; on Linux press `Ctrl+H` in your file manager.
